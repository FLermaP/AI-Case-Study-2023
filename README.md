From beginnig to now
* ExlService started as an email processing company. It helped dot-com companies like 1-800-Flowers.com and Amazon.com (AMZN) provide better service to their customers via email. The math made sense initially. It cost $3 to process emails in the U.S., but just $1 in India where the company was based then. So, ExlService charged $2, earning a nice profit while also saving its clients' money.
