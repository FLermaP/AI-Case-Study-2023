### From beginning to now

* ExlService started as an email processing company. It helped dot-com companies like 1-800-Flowers.com and Amazon.com (AMZN) provide better service to their customers via email. The math made sense initially. It cost $3 to process emails in the U.S., but just $1 in India where the company was based then. So, ExlService charged $2, earning a nice profit while also saving its clients' money.
* It later shifted to a Transaction-processing business. Back-office type of work such as insurance policy administration and mortgage processing.
* Trying to position the company in a better situation Kapoor decided to go into Data Analitics which was "sold" as "Higher Complexity" work as a way to stand out from other companies.

* When it comes to funding a STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT was found dated November 14,2002. In this agreement FT Ventures and Oak Hill Capital Partners L.P. agreed to Invest $10,000,000.00 dollars into EXLService Holdings which was to be received by EXLService Holdings within 30 days of the closing of the agreement

## Results

* Regarding the success of the company:
  * An article published on October 12, 2023 in Yahoo Finance titled  **Why You Should Retain ExlService (EXLS) in Your Portfolio** starts with :
    
    > **ExlService Holdings, Inc.** EXLS, a leading data analytics and digital solutions firm, partners with clients to boost business outcomes and drive growth. The company leverages deep domain expertise, data, advanced analytics, cloud, artificial intelligence (AI), and Machine Learning (ML) to deliver agile solutions and manage complex operations for top companies across industries like insurance, healthcare, banking, media, and retail.
    
  * According to a publication in EXL's news room, **The Clinical and Care Management Operations – Services PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2023** named EXL amongst the leaders. This was confirmed by visiting the [Everest Group](https://www2.everestgrp.com/reportaction/EGR-2023-53-R-6050/Marketing?_ga=2.216571794.525816873.1690815737-1339341408.1674752911) website and reviewing an extract of the report valued in $6,499. According to the EXL site the report states that :
    
      > “EXL’s wide portfolio of technology offerings, ranging from point solutions to end-to-end integrated platforms, flexibility of solutions stack to cater to a diverse set of enterprises across sizes, and deep clinical talent pool have enabled it to be positioned as a Leader in Everest Group’s CCM Operations – Services PEAK Matrix® Assessment 2023.”
      
* Trying to compare this to other similar companies no clear metrics where found. Common features constantly mentioned on sites that rate the top Data Analytics companies seemed to be
  *   Experience in years serving a certain industry,
  *   Type of Services they offer,
  *   Stock Market Performance
  *   The size of their top customers. While some companies mention "One of the top 3 Insurance Companies" others mention specific companies like Walmart, Toyota, 21st Century Fox, etc.

## Recommendations

* Currently the company is advertising among their Products/Services "Data Governance as a Service (DGaaS)" and "Automating Audit using AI", this last one seems to be mainly aimed at Insurance companies. 

* There is a ***BIG*** room for the use of AI to grow in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** . Internal Audit usually takes a lot of Humans and a lot Human Hours in monotonous tasks like finding documents and going through looking for the needed compliance information. Monotonous tasks which AI should be able to do more efficiently in a small fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost. This would reduce the **"looking for"** time and allow the auditor to just review the results.
